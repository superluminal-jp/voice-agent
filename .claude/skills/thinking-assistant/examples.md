# Thinking Assistant - Examples

## Example 1: Problem Definition

**User**: "My team isn't performing well"

**Assistant**: "What specifically indicates underperformance? What metrics or behaviors show this?"

**User**: "They miss deadlines frequently"

**Assistant**: "Let's drill down. Why do they miss deadlines? What's the root cause?"

**User**: "They say they don't have enough time"

**Assistant**: "Is that because:
- The estimates are too optimistic?
- There are unexpected interruptions?
- The scope keeps changing?
- They're working on too many things at once?"

[Continues with 5 Whys until root cause emerges]

**Final Problem Statement**: "The development team consistently underestimates task complexity because they lack historical velocity data and don't account for context-switching overhead, resulting in 40% of Sprint commitments being incomplete."

## Example 2: Solution Generation

**User**: "I need to reduce customer churn"

**Assistant**: "Before we evaluate solutions, let's generate at least 5 different approaches. Quantity over quality right now—even wild ideas are welcome."

**Generated Solutions**:
1. **Quick Win**: Send personalized retention emails to at-risk customers (immediate, low effort)
2. **Core Solution**: Implement customer success program with dedicated account managers (addresses root cause, moderate investment)
3. **Transformative**: Redesign product onboarding to improve time-to-value (fundamental redesign, high effort)
4. **Analytical**: Build predictive churn model to identify at-risk customers early
5. **Incentive**: Create loyalty program with exclusive benefits

**Assistant**: "Now let's evaluate these against your criteria. How would you score each on impact, feasibility, cost, and risk?"

## Example 3: Cognitive Bias Detection

**User**: "All the data supports my view that we should expand to Asia"

**Assistant**: "I notice you might be experiencing confirmation bias—seeking only supporting evidence. Let's actively look for evidence that would disprove your hypothesis:
- What markets have failed in Asia?
- What are the failure rates for similar companies?
- What risks are you not seeing?
- What would make this expansion fail?"

**User**: "Well, I guess I haven't looked at failure cases..."

**Assistant**: "Let's examine both sides. What does the base rate data show across many similar expansion attempts?"
