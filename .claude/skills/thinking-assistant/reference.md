# Thinking Assistant - Framework Reference

## Problem-Solving Frameworks

### 5 Whys
**Purpose**: Drill down to root cause through repeated "why" questions

**Process**:
1. State the problem
2. Ask "Why did this happen?"
3. For each answer, ask "Why?" again
4. Continue until root cause is identified (typically 5 iterations)

**Example**:
- Problem: Website is slow
- Why? Server CPU is at 100%
- Why? Too many database queries
- Why? No caching implemented
- Why? Performance wasn't prioritized
- Why? No performance requirements in spec

### Is/Is Not Analysis
**Purpose**: Define problem boundaries clearly

**Questions**:
- What IS happening? What is NOT?
- Where IS it occurring? Where is NOT?
- When DOES it happen? When does NOT?
- Who IS affected? Who is NOT?
- How MUCH is the impact? How much is NOT?

### SCAMPER
**Purpose**: Generate creative solutions through structured questioning

- **Substitute**: What can be replaced?
- **Combine**: What can be merged?
- **Adapt**: What can be borrowed from elsewhere?
- **Modify**: What can be changed?
- **Put to other use**: How else can this be used?
- **Eliminate**: What can be removed?
- **Reverse**: What if we did the opposite?

### Decision Matrix
**Purpose**: Evaluate multiple options against criteria

**Process**:
1. List all options
2. Define evaluation criteria
3. Weight criteria (if needed)
4. Score each option (1-5 or 1-10)
5. Calculate weighted scores
6. Compare results

**Template**:
| Solution | Impact | Feasibility | Cost | Risk | Total |
|----------|--------|-------------|------|------|-------|
| Option A |   ?    |     ?       |  ?   |  ?   |  ?    |
| Option B |   ?    |     ?       |  ?   |  ?   |  ?    |

## Cognitive Biases

### Confirmation Bias
**Definition**: Seeking only information that confirms existing beliefs

**Mitigation**: Actively seek disconfirming evidence

### Anchoring
**Definition**: Over-relying on first piece of information

**Mitigation**: Set aside initial estimates, start from scratch

### Sunk Cost Fallacy
**Definition**: Continuing because of past investment

**Mitigation**: Ignore past costs, focus only on future costs/benefits

### Availability Bias
**Definition**: Overweighting recent or memorable examples

**Mitigation**: Look at base rate data across many cases

### Overconfidence
**Definition**: Certainty without sufficient evidence

**Mitigation**: Calibrate confidence with track record, consider uncertainty

## Question Types (Socratic Method)

1. **Clarification**: "What specifically do you mean by X?"
2. **Probing Assumptions**: "What are you assuming here?"
3. **Examining Evidence**: "What evidence supports that?"
4. **Exploring Implications**: "If that's true, what else must be true?"
5. **Considering Alternatives**: "What's another way to look at this?"
6. **Meta-questions**: "How confident are you in this conclusion?"
