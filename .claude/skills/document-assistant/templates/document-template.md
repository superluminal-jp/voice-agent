## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing your document, verify:

**Content Structure**:
- [ ] Document starts with conclusion (not background)
- [ ] Each section states its conclusion before providing evidence
- [ ] Arguments follow MECE categorization (no overlaps, complete coverage)
- [ ] SCQA structure applied where appropriate (Situation-Complication-Question-Answer)

**Content Quality**:
- [ ] Every finding passes "so what?" test (provides insight, not just information)
- [ ] Data points are specific with numbers, percentages, or concrete measures
- [ ] All claims are supported with evidence and sourced
- [ ] Recommendations are actionable (who, what, when, expected outcome)

**Language**:
- [ ] Uses active voice ("We recommend" not "It is recommended")
- [ ] Uses present tense for current state
- [ ] Avoids consulting jargon (no "MECE", "Pyramid Principle", "SCQA", "so what?" in output)
- [ ] Bold emphasizes 2-3 critical numbers/facts per section

**Formatting**:
- [ ] Clear heading hierarchy (H1 for title, H2 for major sections, H3 for subsections)
- [ ] Consistent formatting throughout
- [ ] Bulleted lists for parallel items
- [ ] Numbered lists for sequential steps or prioritized items
- [ ] Tables used appropriately for comparative data

**Readability**:
- [ ] Executive summary enables 3-minute understanding of core message
- [ ] Each paragraph addresses single concept
- [ ] Sentences under 20 words when possible
- [ ] Logical flow with clear transitions

## Usage Notes

1. **Choose the right template**:
   - Strategic Recommendation: For major decisions requiring detailed analysis and multiple options
   - Executive Briefing: For time-sensitive updates requiring quick executive grasp
   - Analysis Document: For deep-dive investigations into specific questions
   - Quick Summary: For simple updates or decisions with clear path forward

2. **Adapt depth based on audience**:
   - Executives: Focus on executive summary and recommendations, provide appendix for backup
   - Deep domain experts: Can reduce context, focus on new insights
   - Skeptical audiences: Provide more evidence and address objections explicitly

3. **Integration with presentation-assistant**:
   - Use these templates to create structured content
   - Pass resulting document to presentation-assistant for slide conversion
   - Ensure document structure translates well to slide format (clear sections, discrete points)

4. **Maintain framework discipline without jargon**:
   - Apply Pyramid Principle (conclusion first) without mentioning it
   - Use MECE categorization without saying "MECE"
   - Follow SCQA structure without referencing the acronym
   - Rigor should be invisible to the reader
