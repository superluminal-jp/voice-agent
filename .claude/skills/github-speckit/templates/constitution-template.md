# Project Constitution

## Core Principles

[Non-negotiable architectural decisions that apply to all features]

Examples:
- All code must be in TypeScript
- No external UI component libraries
- All APIs must be RESTful
- All data must be validated at boundaries

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: [framework, e.g., React, Vue, Angular]
- **Backend**: [runtime/framework, e.g., Node.js, .NET, Python]
- **Database**: [type, e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQLite]
- **Deployment**: [platform, e.g., AWS, Azure, Vercel]

## Development Standards

- **Language**: [TypeScript/JavaScript/Python/etc.]
- **Testing**: [framework + coverage requirements, e.g., Jest with ≥80% coverage]
- **Code Style**: [linter + formatter, e.g., ESLint + Prettier]
- **Documentation**: [requirements, e.g., JSDoc for all public APIs]

## Constraints

- **No**: [banned libraries/patterns, e.g., jQuery, class components in React]
- **Must**: [required patterns/practices, e.g., use functional components, type hints]
- **Prefer**: [architectural preferences, e.g., composition over inheritance]

## Security & Compliance

[Authentication, authorization, data protection rules]

Examples:
- All user inputs must be validated
- Sensitive data must be encrypted
- Authentication required for all API endpoints
- GDPR compliance for EU users

## Performance Requirements

[If applicable]

Examples:
- Page load time < 2 seconds
- API response time < 200ms for 95th percentile
- Support for [X] concurrent users

## Accessibility Standards

[If applicable]

Examples:
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
